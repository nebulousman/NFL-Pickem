NFL Pick'em Pool

This is a work in progress. The goal is to automate administration of an office NFL pool with special rules. Ideally it would run on a standard laptop without installation of additional software. Requirements include 1) ease of use â€“ non-technical end user; 2) automated spread, score retrieval, and storage; 3) score calculation.

pool rules:
1 - Players select a minimum of 4 game winners, against the spread, each week.
2 - For every correct selection player receives +10 points.
3 - For every incorrect selection player receives -11 points. No selection = incorrect
4 - Player with most points at the end of regular season is the pool winner.

Games and spreads and player standings are generated and distributed each week.
