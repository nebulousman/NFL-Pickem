# NFL-Pick'em Pool

This is a work in progress. The goal is to automate administration of an office NFL pool with special rules. Ideally it would run on a standard laptop without installation of additional software. Requirements include:
1. Ease of use;
2. Automated spread, score retrieval, and storage;
3. Score calculation.

pool rules:
* Players select a minimum of 4 game winners, against the spread, each week.
* For every correct selection player receives +10 points.
* For every incorrect selection player receives -11 points. No selection = incorrect
* Player with most points at the end of regular season is the pool winner.

Games and spreads and player standings are generated and distributed each week.
